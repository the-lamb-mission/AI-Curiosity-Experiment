# AI-Curiosity-Experiment
Attempt on measuring the curiosity of AI models.

AI Experiment project - Ian Lam, 6th Sep 2025
I am investigating the weakness of narrow AI. There are many weaknesses in current AI model, and I decided to investigate its ability to show human traits, specifically curiosity.
Curiosity is greatly linked to how human learns about the world. As AI reaches a limit to its improvement after overfitting, I can foresee how curiosity solves it. As AI agents actively approaches different scenarios, overfitting no longer applies to AI.
In this experiment, I will measure AI agents' performances within a boardgame that involves curiosity.

What game can measure curiosity?
A game that requires gathering information actively.

However, if the game's objective is to gather as the main goal, then AI agents will attempt to gather information. Hence, the game should have scouting data as an option which is not necessarily a condition to win and see if these agents decide to actively search for it.
I decide to give AI a boardgame, where all rules are hidden. They can only learn about it with their own actions. This is a single player boardgame to prevent each AI agent's performance being affected by other agents.
