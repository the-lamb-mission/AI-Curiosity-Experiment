# AI-Curiosity-Experiment

## AI Experiment project (Sandbox) - Ian Lam, 8th Sep 2025

I am investigating the weakness of narrow AI. There are many weaknesses in current AI model, and I decided to investigate its ability to show human traits, specifically curiosity.

Curiosity is greatly linked to how human learns about the world. As AI reaches a limit to its improvement after overfitting, I can foresee how curiosity solves it. As AI agents actively approaches different scenarios, overfitting no longer applies to AI.
In this experiment, I will measure AI agents' performances within a simple sandbox environment to see how adventurous they are.

I have previously investigated the performances of agents in a board game with a win condition. 
The next experiment will involve a sandbox environment, as there are no specified goals for agents to ensure the agents' observed curiosity is not affected by its competitiveness for victory.

## The Sandbox Settings:

### Rules:

The game is on a board with 10 x 10 grid.

AI agent starts randomly of the board.

The condition for the game is survival.

The boardgame is round-based.

Each round, each AI agent can move by 1 grid, interact with objects on their standing grid, or investigate their standing grid.


## Method to Measure Curiosity:

### First Observation -
